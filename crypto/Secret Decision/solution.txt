1. First of all fix the python script.

    Correct line 18: zipfilename = 'sekret_file.zip'

    Correct line 23 :  numbers_set = '0123456789'
    # Select numbers whose combination lies between 500 BC TO 4000 AD

    Add line 21  : line= file1.readlines() 

    Change line 30 to: password = player.strip()+''.join(c)



2. After opening the folder there is a txt file that is encoded with ROT13. Use a ROT13 decoder to decode the message to 
    get the code to unlock the next zip file.
3. After opening the 2nd zip file, the flag is in an mp3 file. But it is not an mp3 file - it is actually a gif file. 
    The file extension has to be renamed to gif to open the file.

    Flag: jctf{wh@t_@_be@utiful_six}
