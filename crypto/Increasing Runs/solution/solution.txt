I have shifted each and every alphabet with corresponding prime number in increasing order.
ex:
primes=[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29,....
Plain text: "abcde"
Shift pattern:
a ->2 ==c
b ->3 ==e
c ->5 ==h
d ->7 ==k
e ->11 ==p

Therefore Cipher= "cehkp"

Char like '!' , '{' , '}' , '_' remain unchanged

Required flag is = "{Congrats!!!_You_are_our_lucky_winner}"
